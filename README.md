# mlops-test-train

#Project Summary: 
The animal_classification.py program loads the Zoo dataset, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest Classifier model, evaluates its performance, performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, evaluates the tuned model, and saves the trained model to a file named animal_classification_model.joblib
