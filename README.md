#MLOps Project
This project covers the fundamentals and hands-on practices of MLOps, from setting up CI/CD pipelines to deploying and orchestrating machine learning models. The project is divided into four modules, each focusing on different aspects of MLOps.

#Project Summary: 
The animal_classification.py program loads the Zoo dataset, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest Classifier model, evaluates its performance, performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, evaluates the tuned model, and saves the trained model to a file named animal_classification_model.joblib

#Modules
#M1: MLOps Foundations
Objective: Understand the basics of MLOps and implement a simple CI/CD pipeline.

Tasks:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
Implement version control with Git, including branching, merging, and pull requests.
Deliverables:
A report detailing CI/CD pipeline stages.
Screenshots/logs of pipeline runs.
A Git repository with branch and merge history.

#M2: Process and Tooling
Objective: Gain hands-on experience with MLOps tools such as MLflow and DVC.
Tasks:
Use MLflow to track experiments and record model metrics, parameters, and results.
Use DVC for dataset versioning and demonstrate reverting to a previous dataset version.
Deliverables:
MLflow experiment logs.
DVC repository with dataset versions.

#M3: Model Experimentation and Packaging
Objective: Train and tune a model, then package it for deployment.
Tasks:
Perform hyperparameter tuning using libraries like Optuna or GridSearchCV.
Package the tuned model with Docker and Flask.
Deliverables:
Report on hyperparameter tuning.
Dockerfile and Flask application code.
Screenshots of the model running in a Docker container.

#M4: Model Deployment & Orchestration (Optional)
Objective: Deploy and orchestrate a model using Kubernetes.
Tasks:
Deploy the Dockerized model to a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
Set up Kubernetes for orchestration and create a Helm chart for managing deployments.
Deliverables:
Link to the deployed model endpoint.
Kubernetes configuration files and Helm chart.
Report on the deployment and orchestration process.
